# time_complexity
The objective is to build a library to be able to estimate time complexity of machine learning models.

In data science to be able to compare and analyze the necessary time to compute and get result out of machine learning learning models can be difficult and hazardous. 

What we find on the internet regarding machine learning time complexity is more related to Big O and Big Th√©ta computed on Operation Algorithms that are basically sub-algorithms that are used to build machine learning algorithms. No one has time or energy to re-estimate each machine learning algorithm Big O based on sub-algorithms.
